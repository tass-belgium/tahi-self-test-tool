# 
# 2.2 Message Source Address Determination
# 
#    A node that sends an ICMPv6 message has to determine both the Source
#    and Destination IPv6 Addresses in the IPv6 header before calculating
#    the checksum.  If the node has more than one unicast address, it must
#    choose the Source Address of the message as follows:
# 
#     (a) If the message is a response to a message sent to one of the
#         node's unicast addresses, the Source Address of the reply must
#         be that same address.
# 
#     (b) If the message is a response to a message sent to a multicast or
#         anycast group in which the node is a member, the Source Address
#         of the reply must be a unicast address belonging to the
#         interface on which the multicast or anycast packet was received.
# 
#     (c) If the message is a response to a message sent to an address
#         that does not belong to the node, the Source Address should be
#         that unicast address belonging to the node that will be most
#         helpful in diagnosing the error. For example, if the message is
#         a response to a packet forwarding action that cannot complete
#         successfully, the Source Address should be a unicast address
#         belonging to the interface on which the packet forwarding
#         failed.
# 
#     (d) Otherwise, the node's routing table must be examined to
#         determine which interface will be used to transmit the message
#         to its destination, and a unicast address belonging to that
#         interface must be used as the Source Address of the message.

#                   to this Echo Request.  May be zero.
# 
#    Sequence Number
# 
#                   A sequence number to aid in matching Echo Replies
#                   to this Echo Request.  May be zero.
# 
#    Data           Zero or more octets of arbitrary data.
# 
#    Description
# 
#    Every node MUST implement an ICMPv6 Echo responder function that
#    receives Echo Requests and sends corresponding Echo Replies.  A node
#    SHOULD also implement an application-layer interface for sending Echo
#    Requests and receiving Echo Replies, for diagnostic purposes.
# 
#    Upper layer notification
# 
#    Echo Request messages MAY be passed to processes receiving ICMP
#    messages.
