# 
# RFC2460
# 
# 4.2  Options
# 
#    Two of the currently-defined extension headers -- the Hop-by-Hop
#    Options header and the Destination Options header -- carry a variable
#    number of type-length-value (TLV) encoded "options", of the following
#    format:
# 
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
#       |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
#       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
# 
#       Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.
# 
#       Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option
#                            Data field of this option, in octets.
# 
#       Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
#                            data.
# 
#    The sequence of options within a header must be processed strictly in
#    the order they appear in the header; a receiver must not, for
#    example, scan through the header looking for a particular kind of
#    option and process that option prior to processing all preceding
#    ones.
# 
#    The Option Type identifiers are internally encoded such that their
#    highest-order two bits specify the action that must be taken if the
#    processing IPv6 node does not recognize the Option Type:
# 
#       00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.
# 
#       01 - discard the packet.
# 
#       10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
#            packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an
#            ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's
#            Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#       <B>11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
#            Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter
#            Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
#            pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#    The third-highest-order bit of the Option Type specifies whether or
#    not the Option Data of that option can change en-route to the
#    packet's final destination.  When an Authentication header is present
#    in the packet, for any option whose data may change en-route, its
#    entire Option Data field must be treated as zero-valued octets when
#    computing or verifying the packet's authenticating value.
# 
#       0 - Option Data does not change en-route
# 
#       1 - Option Data may change en-route
# 
#    The three high-order bits described above are to be treated as part
#    of the Option Type, not independent of the Option Type.  That is, a
#    particular option is identified by a full 8-bit Option Type, not just
#    the low-order 5 bits of an Option Type.
# 
#    The same Option Type numbering space is used for both the Hop-by-Hop
#    Options header and the Destination Options header.  However, the
#    specification of a particular option may restrict its use to only one
#    of those two headers.
# 
#    Individual options may have specific alignment requirements, to
#    ensure that multi-octet values within Option Data fields fall on
#    natural boundaries.  The alignment requirement of an option is
#    specified using the notation xn+y, meaning the Option Type must
#    appear at an integer multiple of x octets from the start of the
#    header, plus y octets.  For example:
# 
#       2n    means any 2-octet offset from the start of the header.
#       8n+2  means any 8-octet offset from the start of the header,
#             plus 2 octets.
# 
# 
# 4.6  Destination Options Header
# 
#    The Destination Options header is used to carry optional information
#    that need be examined only by a packet's destination node(s).  The
#    Destination Options header is identified by a Next Header value of 60
#    in the immediately preceding header, and has the following format:
# 
#     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
#     |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |                               |
#     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
#     |                                                               |
#     .                                                               .
#     .                            Options                            .
#     .                                                               .
#     |                                                               |
#     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
# 
#    Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
#                         immediately following the Destination Options
#                         header.  Uses the same values as the IPv4
#                         Protocol field [RFC-1700 et seq.].
# 
#    Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
#                         Destination Options header in 8-octet units, not
#                         including the first 8 octets.
# 
#    Options              Variable-length field, of length such that the
#                         complete Destination Options header is an
#                         integer multiple of 8 octets long.  Contains one
#                         or  more TLV-encoded options, as described in
#                         section 4.2.
# 
#    The only destination options defined in this document are the Pad1
#    and PadN options specified in section 4.2.
# 
#    Note that there are two possible ways to encode optional destination
#    information in an IPv6 packet: either as an option in the Destination
#    Options header, or as a separate extension header.  The Fragment
#    header and the Authentication header are examples of the latter
#    approach.  Which approach can be used depends on what action is
#    desired of a destination node that does not understand the optional
#    information:
# 
# 
#       o  If the desired action is for the destination node to discard
#          the packet and, only if the packet's Destination Address is not
#          a multicast address, send an ICMP Unrecognized Type message to
#          the packet's Source Address, then the information may be
#          encoded either as a separate header or as an option in the
#          Destination Options header whose Option Type has the value 11
#          in its highest-order two bits.  The choice may depend on such
#          factors as which takes fewer octets, or which yields better
#          alignment or more efficient parsing.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#       o  <B>If any other action is desired, the information must be encoded
#          as an option in the Destination Options header whose Option
#          Type has the value 00, 01, or 10 in its highest-order two bits,
#          specifying the desired action (see section 4.2).</B>
